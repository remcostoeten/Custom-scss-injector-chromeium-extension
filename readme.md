# HTML to JSX Converter & Custom SCSS Injector

This repository contains two browser extensions:

## HTML to JSX Converter
A browser extension to convert HTML code to JSX for React applications.

## Custom SCSS Injector
A browser extension to inject custom SCSS code into web pages, as described in the [Custom-scss-injector-chromeium-extension](https://github.com/your_username/Custom-scss-injector-chromeium-extension) repository.

Both extensions can be used in Chromium-based browsers (such as Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge).
